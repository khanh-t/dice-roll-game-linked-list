# dice-roll-game-linked-list

Simple Dice Roll game implemented with a linked list data structure. 
How the game works:
Add the players you want in DriveDriver. The program will roll two dices for a 
player, sum the result then move on to the next player. If you roll snake eyes, you're
eliminated. First player to reach 100 or last player standing wins.
